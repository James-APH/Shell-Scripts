# Scripts

This folder will contain all of the scripts that I use to automate
my the various technology that I use.

If you want to use one or any of these scripts create a clone of
this folder in your home directory, and rename it to scripts, the
following headers will explain what to do to compile the script
(if it needs it) and how to add it to your zshrc.

## CPP Project Set-Up

Run the following code:

```sh
chmod +x cpp_project_set_up.sh
```

Add the following code to your zshrc:

```sh
alias cpp_init="~/scripts/cpp_project_set_up.sh"
```
